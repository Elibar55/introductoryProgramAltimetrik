The difference betweeen merge and rebase commands is that while merge keeps track of the changes historically , rebase rewrites it.

Merge joins developmente histories.

Rebase commits on top of another base branch.


#Branching strategy

A branching strategy, is the strategy that software development teams adopt when writing, merging and deploying code when using a version control system.

It is essentially a set of rules that developers can follow to stipulate how they interact with a shared codebase.

##A BRANCHING STRATEGY AIMS TO:
Enhance productivity by ensuring proper coordination among developers
Enable parallel development
Help organize a series of planned, structured releases
Map a clear path when making changes to software through to production
Maintain a bug-free code where developers can quickly fix issues and get these changes back to production without disrupting the development workflow

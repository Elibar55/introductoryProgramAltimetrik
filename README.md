##What is Javascript?

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.
It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies beeing HTML and CSS the others.

The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:

    Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.

    Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. "Player 1: Chris".

    Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.

    And much more!
